        "\n",
        "**Scenario:**\n",
        "Design a fundamental software system for a small parking lot. This system will manage different types of parking spaces and allow vehicles to park and unpark.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Requirements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Vehicles:**\n",
        "    * Every `Vehicle` must have a `license_plate` (unique string) and a `vehicle_type` (e.g., \"Car\", \"Motorcycle\").\n",
        "    * Method: `display_info()` to show its details.\n",
        "    * *Simplification:* We won't have a complex inheritance hierarchy for vehicles. All vehicles will be instances of a single `Vehicle` class, but with different `vehicle_type` values.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Parking Spaces:**\n",
        "    * Every `ParkingSpace` has a `space_id` (unique string), tracks if it `is_occupied`, and stores the `Vehicle` currently parked there (if any).\n",
        "    * Methods:\n",
        "        * `occupy_space(vehicle)`: Parks a vehicle in this specific space.\n",
        "        * `vacate_space()`: Unparks the vehicle from this specific space.\n",
        "        * `is_available()`: Checks if the space is currently empty.\n",
        "    * **Abstraction:** All parking spaces must specify their `space_type` (e.g., \"Standard\", \"Motorcycle\") and implement a `can_park(vehicle)` method to determine if a given vehicle type fits in *this specific space*.\n",
        "    * **Specialized Parking Spaces:**\n",
        "        * `StandardSpace`: Can park any `Vehicle` type.\n",
        "        * `MotorcycleSpace`: Can *only* park `Motorcycle` type vehicles.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Parking Lot:**\n",
        "    * The `ParkingLot` manages a collection of `ParkingSpace` objects.\n",
        "    * It should be able to:\n",
        "        * `add_space(space)`: Add a new parking space to the lot.\n",
        "        * `park_vehicle(vehicle)`: Finds the *first available and suitable* space for the given vehicle and parks it.\n",
        "        * `unpark_vehicle(license_plate)`: Finds the vehicle by its license plate, unparks it from its space.\n",
        "        * `list_all_spaces()`: Display the current status (occupied/available) of all parking spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "<!-- **OOP Concepts to Cover:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Encapsulation:** Protect data by using private/semi-private attributes and accessing/modifying them through public methods or properties.\n",
        "* **Inheritance:** Create a base `ParkingSpace` class and derive specialized `StandardSpace` and `MotorcycleSpace` classes.\n",
        "* **Polymorphism:** The `can_park(vehicle)` method will behave differently depending on the specific `ParkingSpace` type it's called on.\n",
        "* **Abstraction:** `ParkingSpace` will be an Abstract Base Class, forcing subclasses to implement `can_park` and `space_type`.\n",

        "<!-- ### **Explanation of OOP Concepts Used in this Simplified Version:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Encapsulation:**\n",
        "    * **Private-ish Attributes:** Attributes like `__license_plate` in `Vehicle`, `__is_occupied` in `ParkingSpace`, and `__spaces` in `ParkingLot` use two leading underscores (`__`). This indicates they are internal to the object.\n",
        "    * **Public Properties (`@property`):** Controlled read-only access to these internal attributes is provided via `@property` (e.g., `vehicle.license_plate`, `space.is_occupied`).\n",
        "    * **Controlled State Changes:** Modifications to the state of objects happen through public methods. For instance, `space.occupy_space()` manages the `__is_occupied` and `__parked_vehicle` state, ensuring proper linking and validation (`can_park()`). The `ParkingLot` manages its collection of `__spaces` through methods like `add_space`, `park_vehicle`, and `unpark_vehicle`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Inheritance:**\n",
        "    * **`ParkingSpace` as Base Class:** This class defines common attributes (`space_id`, `is_occupied`, `parked_vehicle`) and common methods (`occupy_space()`, `vacate_space()`, `is_available()`) that all types of parking spaces will share.\n",
        "    * **`StandardSpace` and `MotorcycleSpace` as Derived Classes:** These classes inherit all properties and methods from `ParkingSpace`. They specialize the abstract `space_type` and, crucially, provide their own unique implementation of the `can_park()` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Polymorphism:**\n",
        "    * **Method Overriding:**\n",
        "        * The `space_type` property and `can_park(vehicle)` method are defined as abstract in the `ParkingSpace` class and then *overridden* (implemented differently) in `StandardSpace` and `MotorcycleSpace`.\n",
        "    * **Dynamic Dispatch:** In the `ParkingLot.park_vehicle()` method, the line `if space.is_available() and space.can_park(vehicle):` is the key. When `space.can_park(vehicle)` is called, Python automatically executes the correct `can_park` method based on the actual type of `space` object (e.g., if `space` is a `StandardSpace`, its `can_park` is called; if it's a `MotorcycleSpace`, its specific `can_park` is called). The `ParkingLot` doesn't need explicit `if-elif-else` checks for each space type.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Abstraction:**\n",
        "    * **Abstract Base Class (`ABC`):** The `ParkingSpace` class is defined as an `ABC`.\n",
        "    * **Abstract Methods (`@abstractmethod`):** The `space_type` property and `can_park(vehicle)` method are declared as abstract within `ParkingSpace`. This means:\n",
        "        * You cannot directly create an instance of `ParkingSpace` (e.g., `ParkingSpace(\"X01\")` would cause an error).\n",
        "        * Any concrete class that inherits from `ParkingSpace` (like `StandardSpace` or `MotorcycleSpace`) *must* provide its own implementation for `space_type` and `can_park()`. This ensures that all parking space types conform to a basic contract, guaranteeing a consistent interface for the `ParkingLot` to interact with. -->"
